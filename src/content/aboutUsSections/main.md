T-10 is a high-energy, innovative FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics team that takes its name from the classic “T-minus 10” countdown, symbolizing the excitement of launching new ideas and building advanced robotic solutions. Known for their teamwork, creativity, and technical expertise, T-10 members design, program, and construct robots to compete in a variety of challenges that test their skills in engineering, coding, and strategic thinking. Each season, the team works collaboratively to tackle a unique challenge, experimenting with new technologies, improving their designs, and fine-tuning their robot's performance. Beyond the competition, T-10 is dedicated to community outreach, inspiring younger students to explore STEM and robotics, and they strive to embody the core values of Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition®. As they push the boundaries of their robotics skills and creativity, T-10 remains committed to making a positive impact in their community and promoting a passion for STEM.
